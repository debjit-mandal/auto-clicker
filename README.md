# Auto Clicker
An auto clicker using Python involves simulating mouse clicks at specific positions on the screen.

Note: Automated clicking can be against the terms of service of certain applications or websites, and it's important to use such tools responsibly and in compliance with the rules and policies of the services you are interacting with.

Note: 

stop_key = "q"

record_key = "r"

drag_key = "d"

duration_increase_key = "+"

duration_decrease_key = "-"

pause_key = "p"

Before running the script, make sure the `pyautogui` library must be installed by running `pip install pyautogui` in the terminal or command prompt.

Also make sure the `keyboard` library must be installed by running `pip install keyboard` in the terminal or command prompt.

To run this code locally:

`git clone https://github.com/debjit-mandal/auto-clicker`

`cd auto-clicker`

`python main.py`

Feel free to suggest any kind of improvements.
